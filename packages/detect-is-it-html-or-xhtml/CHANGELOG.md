## 3.9.0 (2019-01-20)

- ✨ Various documentation and setup tweaks after we migrated to monorepo
- ✨ Setup refresh: updated dependencies and all config files using automated tools

## 3.3.0 (2018-10-17)

- ✨ Updated all dependencies
- ✨ Restored unit test coverage tracking: reporting in terminal and coveralls.io
- ✨ Restored unit test linting

## 3.2.0 (2018-06-11)

GitHub sold us out. In the meantime, we:

- ✨ Migrated to BitBucket (to host repo + perform CI) and Codacy (for code quality audit)
- ✨ Dropped BitHound (RIP) and Travis
- ✨ Removed `package-lock`

## 3.1.0 (2018-05-03)

- ✨ Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- ✨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
- ✨ Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code — Rollup will remove from production code.

## 3.0.0 (2017-12-09)

- ✨ Rebased in ES node_modules
- ✨ Set up the Rollup (nice rhyming). Now we generate CommonJS, UMD and ES Module (native code) builds.
- ✨ Set up raw ESLint on `airbnb-base` preset with semicolons off. Also linting for AVA unit tests.

## 2.0.0 (2017-03-02)

- ✨ In order to prevent accidental input argument mutation when object is given, now we're throwing a type error when the input argument is present, but of a wrong type. That's enough to warrant a major API change under semver.
