## 2.7.0 (2019-01-20)

- ✨ Various documentation and setup tweaks after we migrated to monorepo
- ✨ Setup refresh: updated dependencies and all config files using automated tools

## 2.1.0 (2018-06-21)

GitHub sold us out. In the meantime, we:

- ✨ Migrated to Bitbucket (to host repo + perform CI) and Codacy (for code quality audit)
- ✨ Dropped BitHound (RIP) and Travis

## 2.0.0 (2018-05-04)

- ✨ Complete rewrite. Now, the only thing `homey` does is it compiles the list of folder names from the input path, then replaces the given placeholder in a given file with the array of the paths to those folder names.

  In practice, Vue.js could drive the homepage and contain all the parts within a single HTML file. All it needs is a list of template folder paths. Vue.js can't "look around" in your file system. You have to give it the list of hardcoded folder names to "bake" into the HTML homepage.

  This means, setup will be simpler now. There's no more two files ("loop-me.html" and "template.html") and everything is more straightforward.

- ✨ Added unit tests!
