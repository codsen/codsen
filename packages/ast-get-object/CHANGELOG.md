## 1.8.0 (2019-01-20)

- ✨ Various documentation and setup tweaks after we migrated to monorepo
- ✨ Setup refresh: updated dependencies and all config files using automated tools

## 1.4.0 (2018-10-13)

- ✨ Updated all dependencies and restored coverage tracking both via terminal when testing and through coveralls.io

## 1.3.0 (2018-06-13)

GitHub sold us out. In the meantime, we:

- ✨ Migrated to BitBucket (to host repo + perform CI) and Codacy (for code quality audit)
- ✨ Dropped BitHound (RIP) and Travis
- ✨ Removed `package-lock`

## 1.2.0 (2018-05-14)

### Improved

- ✨ Now pointing unit tests at ES Modules build, not CommonJS-one. This means, unit test coverage will be correct (higher) because there won't be any missing rows that Babel added which are impossible to cover.
- ✨ Tweaks to ava [config](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/es-modules.md) in `package.json`, properly enabling the `dev` Rollup builds.

## 1.1.0 (2018-05-02)

### Added

- ✨ Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- ✨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
- ✨ Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code — Rollup will remove from production code.

## 1.0.0 (2018-03-10)

- ✨ First public release
