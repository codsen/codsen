## 2.0.0 (2017-11-12)

- ðŸ”§ Rewrote in ES Modules and set up the Rollup to generate 3 flavours of it: CommonJS, UMD and ES Modules.

**PS.** Bumping major just in case the Rollup setup messes up somebody's API's (which it shouldn't but let's be on the safe side).

## 1.0.0 (2017-08-22)

- âœ¨ First public release
