## 1.11.0 (2020-11-28)

Accidental version bump during migration to SourceHut. Sorry about that.

## 1.10.0 (2019-01-20)

- Various documentation and setup tweaks after we migrated to monorepo

## 1.7.0 (2018-12-26)

- Updated all dependencies and restored unit test coverage tracking: reporting in terminal and coveralls.io

## 1.5.0 (2018-06-11)

GitHub sold us out. In the meantime, we:

- Migrated to BitBucket (to host repo + perform CI) and Codacy (for code quality audit)
- Dropped BitHound (RIP) and Travis
- Removed `package-lock`

## 1.4.0 (2018-05-31)

- I found myself looking again and again at the spec, double-checking which function name `isProduction4` or `isProduction4a` is for the first character, which is for second character onwards. To make life easier, I decided to supplement exported function with aliase keys `validFirstChar` and `validSecondCharOnwards` which are the same functions but named more sensibly.

## 1.3.0 (2018-05-03)

- Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
- Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code â€” Rollup will remove them during the builds.

## 1.2.0 (2018-02-16)

### Features

- First checking lowercase letters, then the rest.

## 1.1.0 (2018-02-06)

## 1.0.0 (2018-02-05)

- First public release
