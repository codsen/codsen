## 2.11.0 (2019-01-20)

- âœ¨ Various documentation and setup tweaks after we migrated to monorepo
- âœ¨ Setup refresh: updated dependencies and all config files using automated tools

## 2.5.0 (2018-12-14)

- ðŸ”§ Restored AVA linting, updated all dependencies, added licence to the top of each built file

## 2.4.0 (2018-10-12)

- âœ¨ Updated all dependencies and restored coverage reporting both in terminal and sending to coveralls

## 2.3.0 (2018-05-11)

- âœ¨ Pointed AVA unit tests to ES Modules build, as opposed to previously transpiled CommonJS-one. This means, now unit test code coverage is correct.

## 2.2.0 (2018-04-29)

- âœ¨ Set up Prettier
- âœ¨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
- âœ¨ Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code â€” Rollup will remove them during the builds.

## 2.1.0 (2018-02-11)

- âœ¨ Up until now the [matcher.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/matcher) which was driving the wildcard matching was not-case sensitive. Today they released case-sensitive option and we are setting it on. This will ensure the consistency in matching results.

## 2.0.0 (2017-12-08)

- âœ¨ Removed JS Standard and switched to raw ESLint with `airbnb-base` config. That's because ESLint is always up-to-date (unlike JS Standard which might consume half-year-old ESLint like it does now) and also because `airbnb-*` configs have more rules active. I overrode the setting for semicolons, of course.

Bumping major just in case it breaks somebody's API. But I don't think it will.

## 1.5.0 (2017-07-23)

- âœ¨ Removed `object-assign` from deps, switched to native `Object.assign`
- âœ¨ Set all dev deps except Standard to be latest (`*`) to save time updating them
- Updated All deps

## 1.4.0 (2017-04-23) Sunday evening

- âœ¨ There are some finshy things happening with string wildcard libraries. Namely, [wildcard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wildcard) and [wildstring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wildstring). I was using `wildstring` until I in another of my libraries discovered that it does not support leading wildcards, that is when asterisk is the first character! WTF!!! Same case with `wildcard` too. Proof's [here](https://runkit.com/58fd11151dc1c60013c79f85/58fd132d15bef7001293f41a) and there are other [issues](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/wildcard/issues/9) with its API as well!!!
  SOLUTION: switched to Sindre Sorhus' [matcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/matcher). Small amendments (order of arguments) and one find-and-replace on the method `isMatch`. Problem solved!

## 1.3.0 (2017-04-23)

- âœ¨ You can provide an array (second argument) of strings to check, is ANY of them found in the source (first argument).
- âœ¨ Alternatively, you can set the matching to request that ALL elements from second argument array must be found in the source array (first argument).

## 1.2.0 (2017-04-22)

- âœ¨ Now the input can be not only array, but string as well. It will be converted into an array first and then processed.

## 1.0.0 (2017-04-22)

- âœ¨ First public release
