## 2.2.0 (2018-12-26)

### Features

- Supplement the getter's result with path ([1594a36](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/ast-get-values-by-key/commits/1594a36))

## 2.1.0 (2018-10-13)

- âœ¨ Updated all dependencies and restored coverage tracking both via terminal when testing and through coveralls.io

## 2.0.0 (2018-09-27)

ðŸ”¨ Major API changes: now the result is not array of strings, but array of plain objects, where previous string is under key `val`. This lets us get another key - `path` of that value.

Setter method behaves the same.

## 1.3.0 (2018-06-13)

GitHub sold us out. In the meantime, we:

- âœ¨ Migrated to BitBucket (to host repo + perform CI) and Codacy (for code quality audit)
- âœ¨ Dropped BitHound (RIP) and Travis
- âœ¨ Removed `package-lock`

## 1.2.0 (2018-05-14)

### Improved

- âœ¨ Now pointing unit tests at ES Modules build, not CommonJS-one. This means, unit test coverage will be correct (higher) because there won't be any missing rows that Babel added which are impossible to cover.
- âœ¨ Tweaks to ava [config](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/es-modules.md) in `package.json`, properly enabling the `dev` Rollup builds.

## 1.1.0 (2018-05-02)

### Added

- âœ¨ Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- âœ¨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
- âœ¨ Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code â€” Rollup will remove from production code.

## 1.0.0 (2018-03-11)

- âœ¨ First public release
