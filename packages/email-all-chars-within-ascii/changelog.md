## [1.3.0] - 2017-09-19
### Changed
- Switching to raw ESLint with `airbnb-base` config with no-semicolons override. For posterity, JS Standard sucks - it's neglected by maintainers (consumes half-year-old version of ESLint), it's flagged as insecure by BitHound (because of `shell.js` two levels deep in dependencies) and doesn't have as much rules active as `airbnb` presets.

## [1.2.0] - 2017-09-04
### New
- ✨ `opts.checkLineLength` will throw is lines are more than 999 chars in length. See the [SMTP spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821).

## [1.1.0] - 2017-08-27
### New
- ✨ `opts.messageOnly` throws only a message. Used in [CLI](https://github.com/codsen/email-all-chars-within-ascii-cli/) version of this lib.
