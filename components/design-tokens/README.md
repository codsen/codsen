# Codsen Style Dictionary

It contains all design tokens, for all subrands (codsen, detergent etc.) and all themes (for example, dark and light).

It's aimed at CSS variables, Remix and old-school hand-written CSS files. No `styled-components` or `tailwind`.

Also, no SASS either, although `webapps/*` use PostCSS file format (`*.pcss`) and `postcss-nested` plugin to allow rule nesting.
